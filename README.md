This project focuses on utilizing Tableau to visualize key metrics that are directly correlated with the skills gap we see between Industry and the North Carolina Education System's Career and Technical Education Pathways. The data affiliated with this project is directly from NCED.

Data shows us that there is an evident gap between students who are enrolled in CTE (Career and Technical Education) courses vs CTE pathways (e.g. concentrating). To visualize this in my first dashboard, we see a geospatial view of NC by county showing us this clear gap within NCED's CTE enrollment. On top of this, the industry constantly evolves and outgrows CTE curriculums, and a unique solution to address this problem is an advisory board. The advisory board would be an overseeing entity that is responsible for the health of CTE programs and their ability to prepare students for industry upon completion. This can include insights of necessary skills from industry professionals that should be taught, and connecting CTE educators with recruiters.

Another important factor to consider is employment projections for the short and long term needs in industry. To visualize this, I have two bar plots side by side displaying short term and long term needs based on industry employment. The short term needs dashboard shows 2022 employment rates by industry. The long term needs dashboard shows 2021 employment rates overlapped by an analytical trend line displaying the 2030 projected employment numbers and percent change by industry. These numbers give us key data points to refer to when determining areas where NCED can further invest in for students by properly providing and marketing pathways/concentrations that will equip students for the skillsets needed in the workforce.

Our third and final dashboard shows us the diverse CTE course offerings throughout the state of North Carolina (as of 2022). Again, we have a geospatial map displaying NC at a county level displaying these unique course offerings, and a bar plot at the bottom showing us the least diverse counties (aka our counties of focus). These visuals provide further analysis into areas within the NCED system that experience disparities in course offerings relative to other counties in NC. Counties with low diversity are advised to increase CTE course variety to give students more specialized course offerings through these CTE pathways.

In conclusion, the analysis presented through these Tableau dashboards highlights the critical skills gap between industry demands and the North Carolina Education Systemâ€™s Career and Technical Education (CTE) pathways. By visualizing enrollment disparities, short- and long-term employment projections, and CTE course offerings across counties, we uncover key areas where intervention is necessary. The geospatial and analytical insights demonstrate the need for an advisory board to ensure CTE programs remain aligned with evolving industry needs. Furthermore, enhancing CTE course diversity, especially in underrepresented counties, will better equip students with the skills required to succeed in the workforce, ultimately fostering stronger connections between education and industry in North Carolina.
